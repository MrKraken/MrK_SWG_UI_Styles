# SWG UI Styles

A collection of of UI styles I have created for Star Wars Galaxies, created to be modular and non-destructive. Styles from years back throw everything into one long file, which simply isn't necessary!

## Installation

Copy the archive contents to `SWGEmu Install Directory`.
If you already use custom user styles, it is likely you will already have `ui_palette_ground.inc` in your UI directory. In this case, open with a text editor and insert each `<include>_______</include>` from this project at the end of the file.
